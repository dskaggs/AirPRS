Adobe AIR PoC to demonstrate connecting to a TCP socket and mapping position reports of amateur radio stations

This application started out as a proof-of-concept to see if I could write an AIR application using HTML/Javascript that would connect to a TCP port and translate position reports for amateur radio stations to a format that could be plotted on a map using the Google Map API.

Note: You need Adobe AIR 2.5 minimum installed prior to installing this application

Release Notes:

Version 0.2:
Updated to use a random string in the username passed to the server to authenticate after making the connection to the TCP port.

Version 0.1:
Initial release
